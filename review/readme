* hashmap is java equivalent to the python dictionaries you know and love
* nothing else should seem too unfamiliar to a Thinker

Lab Experiences
- This lab introduced us to new ideas like assigning array values from the contents of another file, using "split", and modifying Strings.
- The idea of changing adjectives in a review was interesting, although sometimes the reviews didn't make complete sense. We're wondering how autogenerated reviews are actually generated, and what they do to improve upon this.
- Creating our own project at the end was fun!
