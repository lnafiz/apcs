//Strangely enough, running the original program without any of today's changes doesn't work.
//I think it was because the class didn't match the file.
//Now I get a new error saying "Editor does not contain a main type"
//In a different file, I get an error with "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem:" 
//Might be due to the platform I'm trying to test this on (Eclipse).
