DISCO -
- What we did in class with the cards is the merge sort method we discussed (with human problems).
- The algorithm carried out in class is recursive, because the method repeats until people receive only 1 card, which would be the base method for sorting.
- Adding on to the 1 card, a 1-item list is already sorted.
- Since the one card is already sorted, you give that one card back to sender because it's already sorted.
- Runtime complexity (big O) is O(nlogn). This is the first time we've (or at least I have) looked at this in class.
  + Dividing decks into halves until one card in left in each deck follows the pattern of log(2n). Comparing cards in two decks and placing them into one list follows a pattern of n. Multiply those, remove those constants, and you get nlog(n).    
  + Mathematically, this is similar to a doubling pattern, but not quite. I looked at the burning trash known as the Internet for more info, apparently this is called a Quasilinear function, which makes sense.

QCC -
- Are there other specifications for splitting decks when you receive odd-numbered decks >1?
- Does comparing first elements of lists and adding them to one list take more time than halving lists? (I'm guessing it does, because n > log(2n))

THINKER FRAMWARE -
- Receive deck. If deck has >1 card, split into halves and give away decks. If deck has =1 card, give it back to sender, as the list is sorted.
- If you receive two decks, compare first elements of both lists. Whichever one is lower will be the first element of the newly formed deck.
- The deck which the card has been removed will shorten the list, moving the elements down.
- If one deck has no more cards, put the rest of the cards from the other deck into the newly formed deck in the order they were originally in.
- Once you finally have one list, return deck to sender.
- Rinse, wash repeat, until there is only 1 person holding one deck.
