  DISCO
   - Stacks can be used to reverse sequences and validating parenthesis
   - When our program encounters a closing parenthesis, it must first check if
     the stack is empty. Otherwise, it will try to get the last item of the
     stack, which doesn't exist.
   - One issue we ran into was how to efficiently and concisely check if an
     opening and closing bracket are of the same type. Our solution was to
     create two String variables, "OPENING" and "CLOSING". Each variable
     stores the three types of opening or closing brackets, such that the
     indexes of each correspond to each other. For example:
       OPENING = "([{"
       CLOSING = ")]}"
     Here, the opening and closing curly parenthesis share the same index, as
     does both other types. In order to easily check if an opening and closing
     parenthesis, you can just check if their indexes are equal.

  QCC
   - Do programming language compilers use stacks when validating parenthesis?
   - How does the efficiency of reversing a String via stacks compare with the
     efficiency of reversing a String via for loops? Both seem to be O(n), but
     using stacks might be more memory-intensive.
