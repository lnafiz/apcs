Time Spent: 

DISCO - 
- We added an instance called CAPSVOWELS and used it in vowel-related methods, such as beginsWithVowel. 
- The rule for y as consonant or vowel is mainly phonetic, which makes it hard to put exact rules in code. So, we did it partially, at least to satisfy the words given. Usually, if a word starts with y or a syllable in a word starts with y, the y is treated as a consonant. Usually it's a vowel when found elsewhere, whether in the middle or the very end.
QCC - 
- How do we have a whole sentence appear once rather than have the program run for every word in the sentence?

HOW WE UTILIZED SCANNER DEMO - 

WHAT CAUSES RUNTIME ERROR IN SCANTIME DEMO - 

NEW IN V_:
V0 - First Pig.java file supplied in ap251/library repo, without methods and instance variables supplied in lab
V1 - Pig.java includes methods and instance variables supplied in lab, tested and verified working. The general rules were tested and work. 
V2 - Pig.java has all rules tested and work EXCEPT Extra Rule #1(Consider y a vowel when appropirate).
V3 - Pig.java has all rules tested and work (somewhat, see DISCO for further details.)
