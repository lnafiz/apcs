HW86 -- What a Racket
2022-03-30w
time spent: 3 hrs

DISCO --
  - expr.split("\\s+") splits a string into a String array by the spaces
  - Integer.parseInt() returns the numerical value of the String

QCC --
  - How can we perform the operation recursively?
  - How can we perform the operation with only one stack?
  - We spent a lot of time talking about the algorithm and collectively understanding it before coding so it took a large amount of time but very little was on the computer.
