DISCO --
  - When implementing an interface that has generic typing, you must generically type the interface name as well.
  - For pop(), we should check if the stack is empty first.
  - Java's LL interface includes getFirst, getLast, removeFirst, removeLast, so we don't have to find out the place to
  carry out these methods ourselves.

QCC --
  - We used .size() methods rather than size instance variables.
  - How can we write better test cases for this?
  - Is Z just a placeholder, or does it have a specific purpose?
