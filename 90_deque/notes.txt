DISCO -
- Very similar to what we did for ALQueue and LLQueue code, using one-line statements in methods by using methods provided in Java API.


QCC -
- We decided to not code additional methods found in the Deque API like offer and poll. They are very similar
to our current methods besides including things like throwing exceptions whenever it's necessary.
