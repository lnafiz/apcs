DISCO:
- Insert has two conditions: either root node is null, or isn't null.
- The transversals have the same code, just rearranged based on the actual algorithms' steps.

QCC:
- The trees can greatly change depending on order of insertion. What if we have to comb through a bunch of data and make a tree for the set of data? Do we have to worry about it, or can we just implement it based on how we're tasked? 


With L = level, d = depth, h = heightâ€¦

1. a perfect binary tree has (2^L)-1 nodes.
2. at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^(L-1) nodes.
3. height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is log base 2 (n+1) - 1.
