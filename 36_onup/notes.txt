Debugging:
Compile-time errors - Incorrect syntax
Run-time errors - Wrong thing happens while program runs
Logic errors - Makes program do wrong thing

Compile-time Errors:
. x error messages != x errors
. Read carefully
. Look at location of error
. Check syntax of code
. Looking at same code as compiler?
. Make backup files
. Sometimes compiler is wrong

Run-time Errors:
. Infinite loop/recursion
. StackOverflow Error
. Add print statements
. Exceptions (lot of them)
. NullPointer - accessed/invoked "null"
. FileNotFound - in the name...
. ArrayIndexOutOfBounds - negative index || index > array.length() - 1
. Arithmetic - bad math
. Simplify print/program

Logic Errors:
. Hard to find (no help)
. Hypothesize
. Does not do supposed to do?
. Does that should not?
. Unexpected effect?
. Int always rounds
. Float is approximate
. == vs .equals()
. Inheritance
. Break up code into components
. Temporary variables

Too Stuck:
. No computer >:(
. Chill out
. Get help
. Hire duckies
. Understand bugs, learn bugs, kill future bugs
